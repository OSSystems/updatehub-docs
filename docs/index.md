## Syntax used on this documentation

We adopted the following syntax across the whole documentation. On text, we use different formats as:

- **bold** - implies technologies and enterprises name.
- *italic* - is used on variables, artifacts, dashboard options, system path and configurations, layers, and file names.
- ``` Code ``` - this format is used on code samples throughout the documentation.

Besides these formats, we also use boxes to provide tips, warnings, and important aspects to consider. For example:

!!! info "Information"
	Infobox provides additional information on what was recently covered.

!!! tip "Tip"
	A tip is an advice on ways to make an operation easier.

!!! warning "Important" 
	Here is information that can directly influence the user and their interactions with our product, for example, the need to upgrade the account to support more than 5 devices.

!!! danger "Attention"
	In this type of box, we find alerts about system configurations and behaviors, such as having to check the SD card before recording an image, for example.
