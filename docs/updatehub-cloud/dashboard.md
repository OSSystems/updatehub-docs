Through the Dashboard, you as the [**UpdateHub**](https://dashboard.updatehub.io/) user, have a rich but simple interface with all the tools required to:

* Create and operate your own *Products*.
* Access *Products* from the *Organizations* you have access to.
* Check when new *Packages* are available for updates.
* Oversee a fleet of *Devices* on the field.
* Deploy updates via an Over-The-Air using *Rollouts*.

Essentially, the Dashboard allows the oversight over the whole **UpdateHub** platform and its operations, making it easy to manage any need that you might have.

    To access the *Dashboard* functions you need to be logged in to your [UpdateHub account](https://auth.updatehub.io/auth/signup/).
